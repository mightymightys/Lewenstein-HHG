Our procedure relies on a separation of nuclear and electron dynamics where we account for the electronic part using the Lewenstein model and nuclear motion enters as a nuclear correlation function. We express the nuclear correlation function in terms of Franck-Condon factors, which allows us to decompose nuclear motion into modes and identify the modes that are dominant in the high-order harmonic generation process. We show results for the isotopes CH 4  and CD 4  and thereby provide direct theoretical support for a recent experiment [S. Baker  et al. , Science  312 , 424 (2006)] that uses high-order harmonic generation to probe the ultrafast structural nuclear rearrangement of ionized methane.},

The laser-driven amplifier is based on parametric stimulated emission and is seeded with high-order-harmonic radiation generated in the same medium. The exponential increase of the soft-X-ray yield with increasing atomic density is experimentally demonstrated for two different sets of laser parameters. A small-signal gain up to 8 103 is obtained in both experiments at about 40	eV in argon using 350-fs-long laser pulses and with 6-fs-long ones at about 260	eV in helium, respectively. This new scheme reduces the pumping threshold for lasing with a comparable conversion efficiency into the millijoule level, which is about two orders of magnitude smaller compared with the conventional plasma X-ray lasers. With a simple model, we can estimate the necessary experimental conditions for identifying the spectral range and the magnitude of the maximum gain, which are in reasonable agreement with our measurements.},

    abstract = {High-order harmonic generation from atoms ionized by femtosecond laser pulses has been a promising approach for the development of coherent short-wavelength sources. However, the realization of a powerful harmonic X-ray source has been hampered by a phase velocity mismatch between the driving wave and its harmonics, limiting their coherent build-up to a short propagation length and thereby compromising the efficiency of a single source. Here, we report coherent superposition of laser-driven soft-X-ray (SXR) harmonics, at wavelengths of 2 5 nm, generated in two successive sources by one and the same laser pulse. Observation of constructive and destructive interference suggests the feasibility of quasi-phase-matched SXR harmonic generation by a focused laser beam in a gas medium of modulated density. Our proof-of-concept study opens the prospect of enhancing the photon flux of SXR harmonic sources to levels enabling researchers to tackle a range of applications in physical as well as life sciences.},

Our trajectory-based analysis of phase-matching reveals several important advantages of using longer laser wavelengths: conversion efficiency can be improved by orders of magnitude, phase-matched build-up of harmonics can be achieved in a jet with a high gas pressure, and isolated attosecond pulses can be extracted from plateau harmonics.},

In the meantime, we are witnessing an exciting progress in the development of powerful and ultrashort pulse laser systems that employ chirped pulse parametric amplifiers. These systems cover a broad class of femtosecond lasers, with output power ranging from a few gigawatts to hundreds of terawatts, with a potential of generating few-optical-cycle pulses at the petawatt power level. In this paper, we discuss the main issues of optical parametric chirped pulse amplification and overview recent progress in the field.},

We obtain high harmonics up to an energy of 5.5 U p  +  I p , surpassing the conventional limit of 3.17 U p  +  I p . For high intensities approaching the threshold for barrier suppression ionization, beyond which no harmonics are generated, this mechanism acquires practical importance as a means to overcome the limit imposed by saturation. We analyse the underlying mechanism using both classical and quantum approaches, and highlight the role of the shaped field in modifying the electron trajectories in the continuum to enhance the collection of kinetic energy from the driving field. Of greatest importance are the trajectories describing electrons ionized across the first peak of the laser field which receive the enhanced kinetic energies responsible for the cut-off extension above the conventional limit. Interestingly, the most energetic trajectories do not contribute to the harmonic cut-off in the single pulse case. We conclude with a discussion of the sub-cycle structure of the emitted harmonic radiation and possible applications of the technique.},

The electron microscope's ability to resolve three-dimensional (3D) structures on the atomic scale is continuing to affect different fields, including materials science and biology. In this Review, we highlight recent developments and inventions made by introducing the fourth dimension of time in electron microscopy. Today, ultrafast electron microscopy (4D UEM) enables a resolution that is 10 orders of magnitude better than that of conventional microscopes, which are limited by the video-camera rate of recording. After presenting the central concept involved, that of single-electron stroboscopic imaging, we discuss prototypical applications, which include the visualization of complex structures when unfolding on different length and time scales. The developed UEM variant techniques are several, and here we illucidate convergent-beam and near-field imaging, as well as tomography and scanning-pulse microscopy. We conclude with current explorations in imaging of nanomaterials and biostructures and an outlook on possible future directions in space-time, 4D electron microscopy. 10.1126/science.1166135},

We performed an experimental study of the high harmonic yield over a wavelength range of 8001850 nm. A thin gas jet was employed to minimize phase matching effects, and the laser intensity and focal spot size were kept constant as the wavelength was changed. Ion yield was simultaneously measured so that the total number of emitting atoms was known.

We have observed the asymmetry in the shape of the harmonic signal and the change of the asymmetry with harmonic order. Furthermore, the dependence of harmonic signals on fundamental intensity were found to be quite different at the specific positions of the laser focus. These experimental results are consistently explained by the medium ionization and the resulting self-defocusing of the laser beam.

Inducing molecular dynamics, wave-packet motion, dissociation, passage through conical intersections, or isomerization by a pump pulse this motion is visualized by the x-ray FEL probe pulse launching keV photoelectrons within a few femtoseconds from specific and well-defined sites, deep core levels of individual atoms, inside the molecule. On their way out, the photoelectrons are diffracted generating a hologram on the detector that encodes the molecular structure at the instant of photoionization, thus providing    femtosecond snapshot images of the molecule from within.  Detailed calculations in various approximations of increasing sophistication are presented and three-dimensional retrieval of the spatial structure of the molecule with \r{A}ngstr\"{o}m spatial resolution is demonstrated. Due to the large photoabsorption cross sections the method extends x-ray-diffraction-based time-dependent structure investigations envisioned at FEL's to new classes of samples that are not accessible by any other method. Among them are dilute samples in the gas phase such as aligned, oriented, or conformer-selected molecules, ultracold ensembles and/or molecular or cluster objects containing mainly light atoms that do not scatter x rays efficiently.},

We find that high harmonic emission from CO 2  and N 2 O molecules is well described by a simple two-center interference model. In contrast, high harmonic emission from N 2  exhibits a very different behavior, not readily explained by assuming that the electron responsible for the high-order harmonic emission recollides with the molecule as a plane wave. These data clearly emphasize the need for more comprehensive models of high harmonic generation from molecules.},

The harmonic emission strengths, first decrease rather steeply for the first orders, then form a long plateau up to the 21st harmonic in xenon, or up to the 33rd harmonic in argon, before decreasing again rather abruptly. The theoretical description of these experiments consists first in the calculation of the photoemission spectra emitted by a single atom. The spectra are obtained by numerically integrating a time dependent Schrodinger equation for the laser-excited rare-gas atom. Second, one must account for collective effects in the medium, described by Maxwell's equations. A theoretical framework for describing the generation and propagation of harmonics in strong laser fields is developed. An numerical solution of the propagation equations for the harmonic fields in xenon at 1064 nm provides results which agree well with experimental data.},

Within a semi-classical model, we show that extremely short phase-stabilized laser pulses offer control over the momentum distribution of the returning electrons. By adjusting the carrier-envelope phase, recollisions can be forced to occur from mainly one side, while retaining a broad energy spectrum. The signatures of the semi-classical distributions are observed in harmonic spectra obtained by the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.},

The accurate calibration of HHG spectra is becoming increasingly important for the determination of electronic structures. The wavelength of the laser harmonics themselves depend on the details of the harmonic geometry and phase matching, making them unsuitable for calibration purposes. In our calibration mode, the target resides directly at the focus of the laser, thereby enhancing plasma emission and suppressing harmonic generation. In HHG mode, the source medium resides in front or after the focus, showing enhanced HHG and no plasma emission lines. We analyze the plasma emission and use it for a direct calibration of our HHG spectra.},

    abstract = {Tunneling, one of the most striking manifestations of quantum mechanics, influences the electronic structure of many molecules and solids and is responsible for radioactive decay. Much of the interaction of intense light pulses with matter commences with electrons tunneling from atoms or molecules to the continuum. Until recently, this starting point was assumed to be the highest occupied orbital of a given system. We have now observed tunneling from a lower-lying state in hydrogen chloride (HCl). Analyzing two independent experimental observables allowed us to isolate (via fragment ions), identify (via molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions), and, with the help of ab initio simulations, quantify the contribution of lower-lying orbitals to the total and angle-dependent tunneling current of the molecule. Our results bolster the emerging tenet that the coherent interaction between different orbitals--which can amplify the impact of lower orbitals--must be considered in tunneling processes. 10.1126/science.1175253},

In the absence of the field; the model supports up to two bound states; which have a large transition dipole moment. Hence; the physical systems best described by the model are molecular ions such as H 2 + . Rates for high-harmonic emission are calculated analytically up to one final quadrature. In terms of the rescattering picture; harmonic emission can be attributed to two different mechanisms: electrons recombine either at the center they started from or at the other one. The latter case allows for three topologically different classes of orbits; which lead to different spectral ranges of harmonics. Two of them are similar to atomic (one-center) harmonic generation; but have different cutoff laws that are no longer proportional to the ponderomotive potential. In the third the electron moves directly from one center to the other. This leads to strong harmonic emission at comparatively low frequencies similar to emission from a two-level atom with the cutoff proportional to the field amplitude rather than the intensity. The molecular dipole phase in this case is almost independent of the field intensity and; at constant intensity; the phases of neighboring harmonics are locked. Different orientations of the two-center system with respect to the field with various polarization configurations are investigated. Most of the observed features lend themselves to interpretation in terms of the simple man's model.},

    abstract = {We present a numerical study of the ultrafast ionization dynamics of H2+ exposed to attosecond extreme ultraviolet (xuv) pulses that goes beyond the Born-Openheimer approximation. The four-dimensional, time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation was solved using a generalization of the finite-element discrete-variable-representation/real-spaceproduct technique used in our previous calculations to include the dynamical motion of the nuclei. This has enabled us to expose the target to any polarized light at arbitrary angles with respect to the molecular axis. Calculations have been performed at different angles and photon energies (=50  eV up to 630 eV) to investigate the energy and orientation dependence of the photoionization probability. A strong orientation dependence of the photoionization probability of H2+ was found at a photon energy of =50  eV. At this energy, we found that the ionization probability is three times larger in the perpendicular polarization than in the parallel case. These observations are explained by the different geometric    cross sections  seen by the photoejected electron as it leaves the molecule. This ionization anisotropy vanishes at the higher-photon energy of 170  eV. When these higher-energy xuv pulses are polarized perpendicular to the internuclear axis, a    double-slit-like  interference pattern is observed. However, we find that the diffraction angle only approaches the classical formula n=sin1(ne/R0), where n is the diffraction order, e is the released electron wavelength, and R0 is the internuclear distance, when ne becomes less than 65\% of R0. These results illustrate the possibility of employing attosecond pulses to perform photoelectron microscopy of molecules.},

The fiber laser delivers 270 fs pulses in the 30-100  J energy range at repetition rates varying from 100 kHz to 1 MHz. A proper focalization allows reaching several 1013 W/cm2 in a gas jet. We have been able to produce and detect harmonics up to order 31 (33.2 nm) in Ar at a 100 kHz repetition rate. High-order harmonic generation at 1 MHz is also demonstrated in Xe up to harmonic 15. The demonstrated extreme UV (XUV) source will bring ultrashort XUV coincidence experiments from synchrotron facilities to tabletop laboratories.},

Clear evidences are shown of the important role played by the p-like character originating from the covalent C-H bond. By constructing a suitable mixture of s-type and p-type atomic wave functions, an excellent agreement between measurements in methane and simulations is found, thus confirming the validity of the developed method as a general tool for the analysis of high-order harmonic generation in complex molecules.},

Using 240-fs pulses; the dependence of the harmonic intensity on the laser intensity of the organic molecules exhibits significant deviations from the behavior of atoms; and shows strong evidence for harmonic generation from molecular fragments as well as the parent molecule. When the pulse duration is reduced to 70 fs; the intensity dependences of the harmonics are similar to those of xenon. This is attributed to the significant reduction in dissociation occurring during the shorter pulse and suggests that high-order harmonic generation in the ultrafast regime will be important in the understanding of molecular electron dynamics in strong fields.},

Harmonics from the 7th to the 13th order were found to have comparable intensities with those produced by xenon at the same density.

No saturation of this harmonic was observed in cyclohexane up to a peak intensity of 2 10 15  W cm -2 ; in contrast with xenon; where saturation was seen above 8 10 14  W cm -2 .

The methods used involve measuring statistical distributions of a well chosen set of physical observables and using a tomographic inversion algorithm to reconstruct the Wigner function and its corresponding wave function or density matrix. Recontructions have been successfully carried out in atomic, molecular, and optical physics.

The intensity dependence of the harmonic signal shows an interesting behaviour of the 13th harmonic, namely an initial suppression followed by a strong enhancement at  85 TW cm -2 , which exceeds the magnitude of the 11th harmonic. This behaviour is a consequence of a resonant atomic process. Numerical calculations were also performed. They partly reproduced the experiment.},

The harmonic dipole moment amplitude and phase is examined as a function of angle between a fixed axis in the frame of the wave function and the continuum electron momentum vector. We then examine, and discuss, the results for a number of molecules where experimental data already exists such as N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, acetylene and allene with orbitals calculated within a Gaussian basis using the GAMESS program. Concrete predictions can be obtained from this procedure against which measurements can be compared.

Data are reported for the rare gases He, Ne, Ar, and Kr, for Na, and for the closed-shell ions  Cu +  and  Ag + . Sum rules are used to analyze the oscillator strength spectral distribution and to attempt extrapolations to still higher energies. The results suggest a classification of atomic subshells into two types with fundamentally different spectral distributions of oscillator strength. One type consists of the subshells  1 s ,  2 p ,  3 d ,  4 f , with nodeless radial wave functions, the other type includes all remaining subshells.

We showed that high harmonic generation can reveal coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics in polyatomic molecules. By exciting large amplitude vibrations in dinitrogen tetraoxide, we showed that tunnel ionization accesses the ground state of the ion at the outer turning point of the vibration but populates the first excited state at the inner turning point. This state-switching mechanism is manifested as bursts of high harmonic light that is emitted mostly at the outer turning point. Theoretical calculations attribute the large modulation to suppressed emission from the first excited state of the ion. More broadly, these results show that high harmonic generation and strong-field ionization in polyatomic molecules undergoing bonding or configurational changes involve the participation of multiple molecular orbitals. 10.1126/science.1163077},

In addition; by manipulating the chirp of the driving laser we can induce and measure a positive or a negative chirp on the XUV pulse.},

    abstract = {The quantitative rescattering theory (QRS) for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) by intense laser pulses is presented. According to the QRS, HHG spectra can be expressed as a product of a returning electron wave packet and the photorecombination differential cross section of the laser-free continuum electron back to the initial bound state. We show that the shape of the returning electron wave packet is determined mostly by the laser. The returning electron wave packets can be obtained from the strong-field approximation or from the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation (TDSE) for a reference atom. The validity of the QRS is carefully examined by checking against accurate results for both harmonic magnitude and phase from the solution of the TDSE for atomic targets within the single active electron approximation. Combining with accurate transition dipoles obtained from state-of-the-art molecular photoionization calculations, we further show that available experimental measurements for HHG from partially aligned molecules can be explained by the QRS. Our results show that quantitative description of the HHG from aligned molecules has become possible. Since infrared lasers of pulse durations of a few femtoseconds are easily available in the laboratory, they may be used for dynamic imaging of a transient molecule with femtosecond temporal resolutions.},

    abstract = {We studied the correlation between the intensity of the strong quasi-monochromatic harmonics (13th harmonic of indium and 17th harmonic of tin) of an 800 nm laser pulse and the characteristics of the plasma in which the harmonics were generated. By varying the intensity of the prepulse that produces the plasma from a solid target, we found an optimum plasma condition under which the intensity of the strong harmonics reached maximum. Fluid simulations suggest that this behaviour is correlated to the maximum density of singly charged ions, which are thought to be responsible for the generation of the strong single harmonics via specific plasma resonances. This result is consistent with the model recently proposed by Milo?evi? ( 2007 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. [/0953-4075/40/17/005] 40 3367 ). We also examined the alternative mechanism of phase matching between the harmonics and the pump laser to explain the role of plasma resonances in the enhancement effect. An optimum plasma condition is found as in the experiments although the relation between the strong single harmonic intensity and the singly charged ion density is not straightforward. The ac Stark broadening of the plasma resonances appears to be a critical parameter for phase matching to occur.},

The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and  ab initio  theory are presented.},

The inversion has been attributed to the quantum interference in the recombination process from the two oxygen centers. Using the Lewenstein model to calculate HHG from fixed CO2 molecules and taking into account the partial alignment of the molecules versus the time delay, we interpret that the inversion is due to the degree of overlap between the partially aligned molecules and the angular dependence of the HHG yield. We also note that the harmonic order where inversion occurs may change with probe laser intensity due to the depletion of the ground state.},

The final-state wave function was obtained using the iterative Schwinger variational method. The effects of initial-state correlation were studied by comparing cross sections obtained using a configuration-interaction-type initial-state wave function with those obtained using a Hartree-Fock initial-state wave function. In this paper we compare our accurate single-center expansion results with other theoretical results. We find that earlier single-center cross sections were not well converged with respect to their expansion parameters. The results of the continuum multiple-scattering method and the Stieltjes-Tchebycheff moment-theory approach are found to be in qualitative but not quantitative agreement with the present results. We also compare our computed total cross sections as well as integrated target angular distributions with experimental results for photoionization leading to the  X   2   g + ;  A   2   u ; and  B   2   u +  states of N 2 + .

APT is formed with Fourier synthesis of high-order harmonic fields of a femtosecond laser pulse. Time-of-flight mass spectra of N+, resulting from the Coulomb explosion of N2 absorbing two photons of APT, efficiently yield correlated signals of APT. The measured autocorrelation trace exhibits that the duration of the pulse should be only 1.3 periods of the extreme ultraviolet carrier frequency. A few interference fringes within the short pulse duration clearly show two types of symmetry, which ensure the phase locking between pulses in APT.},

The resulting interferogram contains sufficient information to completely reconstruct the temporal behavior of the electric field.

The experimental data show that this  l -type doubling may be represented by   = q i J ( J +1) and that the constant  q i  is of the same order as the constant   i  in  B [ v ] = B e -   i ( v i +1    /    2 d i ). The existence of the  l -type doubling also explains the apparent discrepancy that the fundamental bands of HCN and C 2 H 2  do not show a convergence of the  P  and  R  branches while the  Q  branch is distinctly shaded to shorter wave-lengths. A preliminary theoretical treatment of the  l -type doubling is also given. The doubling is due mainly to the fact that in the displaced position of a perpendicular vibration a linear molecule is a slightly asymmetric top; but to some extent also to the Coriolis interaction of different vibrations. The observed values of  q i  are all larger than the calculated ones. Taking the  l -type doubling into account the rotational constants   i  of CO 2  have been newly evaluated and from them and the value  B 000 =0.3895 0  cm -1  the rotational constant  B e  in the equilibrium position is found to be 0.3906 0.0002 cm -1  which gives for the moment of inertia  I e =71.61 10 -40  g cm 2  and for the CO distance  r e =1.1615 10 -8  cm.},

They investigate the influence of the laser pulse width, the excitation wavelength (from the near infrared to the ultraviolet) and the atomic medium on the number of photons produced and on the maximum energy attained. Harmonic generation also depends strongly on the focusing conditions. By using simple arguments and results of numerical calculations in xenon, they show that the conversion efficiency in general follows a simple b3 power law, b denoting the laser confocal parameter, up to a transition regime where the coherence length of the process becomes equal to the medium length. By applying the b3 scaling as a normalization factor, they can then compare experimental results obtained in different focusing geometries. Their experimental data show that the optimization of the photon energy produced is favoured by using long incident wavelengths and light atomic systems with a high ionization energy.},

Wave-function analysis shows that there are two types of resonant states: high-angular-momentum states that stay away from the nucleus and mainly decay by emission of low-energy electrons; and states that are located near the polarization axis.

The obtained numerical and analytical results for a two-state hydrogenlike atom model show that the harmonic spectrum consists of two parts: a usual single-state harmonic spectrum of odd harmonics having the energies (2k+1)Omega and a resonant part with the peaks around the excitation energy DeltaOmega. The energy of the harmonics in the resonant part of the spectrum is equal to DeltaOmega +/- Omega, DeltaOmega +/- 3Omega, .... For energies higher than the excitation energy, the resonant part forms a plateau, followed by a cutoff. The emission rate of the harmonics in this resonant plateau is many orders of magnitude higher than that of the harmonics generated in the presence of the ground state alone. The influence of the depletion of the initial states, as well as of the pulse shape and intensity, is analyzed.},

    abstract = {In the past decade, the understanding of the dynamics of small molecules in intense laser fields has advanced enormously. At the same time, the technology of ultra-short pulsed lasers has equally progressed to such an extent that femtosecond lasers are now widely available. This review is written from an experimentalist's point of view and begins by discussing the value of this research and defining the meaning of the word 'intense'. It continues with describing the Ti : sapphire laser, including topics such as pulse compression, chirped pulse amplification, optical parametric amplification, laser-pulse diagnostics and the absolute phase. Further aspects include focusing, the focal volume effect and space charge. The discussion of physics begins with the Keldysh parameter and the three regimes of ionization, i.e. multi-photon, tunnelling and over-the-barrier. Direct-double ionization (non-sequential ionization), high-harmonic generation, above-threshold ionization and attosecond pulses are briefly mentioned. Subsequently, a theoretical calculation, which solves the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, is compared with an experimental result. The dynamics of {\rm H}_{2}^{ + } in an intense laser field is interpreted in terms of bond-softening, vibrational trapping (bond-hardening), below-threshold dissociation and laser-induced alignment of the molecular axis. The final section discusses the modified Franck-Condon principle, enhanced ionization at critical distances and Coulomb explosion of diatomic and triatomic molecules.},

A time-frequency analysis is used to identify electron recollision and recombination times responsible for the generation of attosecond pulse trains during the nuclear motion. A very strong signature of nuclear motion is seen in the time profiles of high-order harmonics. In the case of high laser intensity (I [?] 1015 W cm[?]2) the nuclear motion shortens the part of the attosecond pulse train originating from the first electron contribution and may enhance the onset of the second electron contribution for longer pulses. Molecular motion thus can act as an important 'time-gating' for controlling the length of generated attosecond pulses. The shape of time profiles of harmonics can thus be used for monitoring the nuclear motion. In the case of lower laser intensity, I [?] 4 x 1014 W cm[?]2, we also find in time profiles a clear signature of electron excitation due to recollision of the returning electron.},

    abstract = {The generation of attosecond-duration light pulses using the high-order harmonic generation process is a rapidly evolving area of research. In this work, we combine experimental measurements with careful numerical analysis, to demonstrate that even relatively long-duration, 15 fs, carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) unstabilized near-infrared (NIR) pulses can generate isolated attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) pulses by the dynamically-changing phase matching conditions in a hollow-core waveguide geometry. The measurements are made using the laser-assisted photoelectric effect to cross-correlate the EUV pulse with the NIR pulse. A FROG CRAB analysis of the resulting traces (photoelectron signal versus photoelectron energy and EUV-NIR delay) is performed using a generalized projections (GP) algorithm, adapted for a wide-angle photoelectron detection geometry and non-CEP stabilized driving laser pulses. In addition, we performed direct FROG CRAB simulations under the same conditions. Such direct simulations allow more freedom to explore the effect of specific pulse parameters on FROG CRAB traces than is possible using the automated GP retrieval algorithm. Our analysis shows that an isolated pulse with duration of H 200 attoseconds can result from CEP unstabilized, high intensity H 15 fs multi-cycle driving pulses coupled into a hollow-core waveguide filled with low-pressure Argon gas. These are significantly longer driving pulses than used in other experimental implementations of isolated attosecond pulses.},

Since then, measurement and control of the subcycle field evolution of few-cycle light have opened the door to a radically new approach to exploring and controlling processes of the microcosm. The hyperfast-varying electric field of visible light permitted manipulation and tracking of the atomic-scale motion of electrons. Striking implications include controlled generation and measurement of single attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet light as well as trains of them, and real-time observation of atomic-scale electron dynamics.

    abstract = {doi: 10.1021/jp063915u The mechanism of electron transfer (ET) from reduced pheophytin (Pheo-) to the primary stable photosynthetic acceptor, a quinone (Q) molecule, is addressed by using high-level ab initio computations and realistic molecular models. The results reveal that the ET process involving the (Pheo- + Q) and (Pheo + Q-) oxidation states can be essentially seen as an ultrafast radiationless transition between the two hypersurfaces taking place via conical intersections (CIs). According to the present findings, an efficient ultrafast ET implies that the Pheo- and Q move toward each other in a given preferential parallel orientation, reaching the most effective arrangement for ET at intermolecular distances (R) around 53 A, where the lowest CIs are predicted. Favored donor/acceptor interactions are related to orientations with some overlap between the lowest occupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the two systems, and they lead to state-crossings at an earlier stage of the movement (larger R). Furthermore, when the topology of the interacting moieties does not make possible the LUMOs overlap, the corresponding diabatic potential energy curves do not intersect. Thus, it is anticipated that large scale motions, which are difficult to monitor experimentally, are actually occurring in the photosynthetic reaction centers of bacteria, algae, and higher plants, to fulfill the observed ultrafast ET processes.},

We show that primary energy conversion is a stepwise process in which an electron is transferred via neighbouring chromophores of the RC. A well-defined chromophore arrangement in a rigid protein matrix, combined with optimised energetics of the different electron carriers, allows a highly efficient charge-separation process. The individual molecular reactions at room temperature are well described by conventional electron-transfer theory.},

The reported relaxation could be probed in real time if the removal of an electron could be achieved on the attosecond time scale. Then the mean field seen by an electron would be changing rapidly enough to initiate the migration. Tyrosine-terminated tetrapeptides have a particularly fast charge migration where in <1 fs the charge arrives at the other end. A femtosecond pulse can be used to observe the somewhat slower relaxation induced by correlation between electrons of different spins. A slower relaxation also is indicated when removing a deeper-lying valence electron. When a chromophoric amino acid is at one end of the peptide, the charge can migrate all along the peptide backbone up to the N end, but site-selective ionization is probably easier to detect for tryptophan than for tyrosine.},

    abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0602663103 The UV chromophores in DNA are the nucleic bases themselves, and it is their photophysics and photochemistry that govern the intrinsic photostability of DNA. Because stability is related to the conversion of dangerous electronic to less-dangerous vibrational energy, we study ultrafast electronic relaxation processes in the DNA base adenine. We excite adenine, isolated in a molecular beam, to its   * state and follow its relaxation dynamics using femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. To discern which processes are important on which timescales, we compare adenine with 9-methyl adenine. Methylation blocks the site of the much-discussed   * state that had been thought, until now, minor. Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that, although adenine and 9-methyl adenine show almost identical timescales for the processes involved, the decay pathways are quite different. Importantly, we confirm that in adenine at 267-nm excitation, the   * state plays a major role. We discuss these results in the context of recent experimental and theoretical studies on adenine, proposing a model that accounts for all known results, and consider the relationship between these studies and electron-induced damage in DNA.},

This ideal waveform has the form of a linear ramp with a dc offset. A genetic algorithm was employed to find an optimized practically achievable waveform composed of a longer wavelength field, to provide the offset, in addition to higher frequency components. This second waveform is found to be capable of generating electron recollision energies as high as those for the perfect waveform while retaining the high recollision amplitudes of a pure sinusoidal wave. Calculations of high harmonic generation demonstrate this enhancement, by increasing the cutoff energy by a factor of 2.5 while maintaining the harmonic yield, providing an enhanced tool for attosecond science.},

S. (2005) . . . .  102, 2023]. The spectra provide evidence for a very efficient excited-state deactivation mechanism that is specific for the WatsonCrick structure and may be essential for the photostability of DNA. Here we report results of  electronic-structure calculations for the excited electronic states of the three lowest-energy conformers of the guanine/cytosine base pair. The calculations reveal that electron-driven interbase proton-transfer processes play an important role in the photochemistry of these systems. The exceptionally short lifetime of the UV-absorbing states of the WatsonCrick conformer is tentatively explained by the existence of a barrierless reaction path that connects the spectroscopic     * excited state with the electronic ground state via two electronic curve crossings. For the non-WatsonCrick structures, the photochemically reactive state is located at higher energies, resulting in a barrier for proton transfer and, thus, a longer lifetime of the UV-absorbing     * state. The computational results support the conjecture that the photochemistry of hydrogen bonds plays a decisive role for the photostability of the molecular encoding of the genetic information in isolated DNA base pairs.},

The technology of attosecond measurement, however, is built on established methods of characterizing femtosecond pulses: the pulse is measured after it has left the region where it was produced. We offer a completely different approach: in situ measurement. That is, we integrate attosecond-pulse production and measurement in a manner that can be applied to many high-order nonlinear interactions. To demonstrate this approach, we combine a low-intensity (<10-3) second-harmonic beam with the fundamental beam, to gently perturb the production process without significantly modifying it. The attosecond-pulse duration is read from the modulation of the even-harmonic signal as a function of the two-field delay. Increasing the second-harmonic intensity slightly (<10-2), we extend measurement to control. We demonstrate control by manipulating the high-harmonic spectrum with high efficiency.},

We used attosecond angular streaking to place an upper limit of 34 attoseconds and an intensity-averaged upper limit of 12 attoseconds on the tunneling delay time in strong field ionization of a helium atom. The ionization field derives from 5.5-femtosecond-long near-infrared laser pulses with peak intensities ranging from 2.3 x 1014 to 3.5 x 1014 watts per square centimeter (corresponding to a Keldysh parameter variation from 1.45 to 1.17, associated with the onset of efficient tunneling). The technique relies on establishing an absolute reference point in the laboratory frame by elliptical polarization of the laser pulse, from which field-induced momentum shifts of the emergent electron can be assigned to a temporal delay on the basis of the known oscillation of the field vector. 10.1126/science.1163439},

@article{Bandulet2008,
    abstract = {Numerous applications of high harmonic generation (HHG), such as attosecond pulse synthesis, depend on the ability to increase the electron recollision energy, which is a quadratic function of the driver wavelength. High-energy infrared pulses obtained from an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) are thus attractive for driving the HHG process, thereby offering the opportunity to yield shorter attosecond pulses. However, the increase in driver wavelength is often outweighed by the poor spatial quality of the OPA source. In this paper, we demonstrate that HHG using OPA signal pulses is significantly improved by spatial filtering in a hollow-core fibre prior to focusing in the gas target in comparison with the unfiltered case. Ion yield measurements in combination with beam profile monitoring in the far field enabled control over the interaction volume. For similar interaction volumes, we observe that with less than half the energy per pulse, the HHG yield can increase by one order of magnitude with spatial filtering. The comparison between the harmonic yields in argon and krypton, and their respective dependence on the peak laser intensity, provide experimental evidence that strongly suggests that the enhancement is due to improved phase matching.},

With a second-harmonic intensity equal to 15\% of the IR intensity the second-harmonic field is strong enough to significantly alter and control the electron trajectories in the generation process. This enables us to tune the central photon energy of the attosecond pulses by changing the phase difference between the IR and the second-harmonic fields. In the time domain the radiation is emitted as a sequence of pulses separated by a full IR cycle. We also perform calculations showing that the effect of even stronger second-harmonic fields leads to an extended tunable range under conditions that are experimentally feasible.},

We discuss the role of atomic dipole matrix elements; electron rescattering processes; and of depletion of the ground state. We present the exact quantum-mechanical formula for the harmonic cutoff that differs from the phenomenological law I p +3.17 U p ; where I p is the atomic ionization potential and U p is the ponderomotive energy; due to the account for quantum tunneling and diffusion effects.},

High-harmonic generation, multiphoton two-electron ejection, and very high energy above-threshold-ionization electrons are all conssequences of this electron-ion interaction. One important parameter which determines the strength of these effects is the rate at which the wave packet spreads in the direction perpendicular to the laser electric field; another is the polarization of the laser.

    abstract = {We discuss, via a numerical calculation, the main properties of atomic photoelectron spectra, as they would be obtained by using a radiation pulse containing  N +1 frequencies associated with a ''Dirac comb'' of  N  higher harmonics together with the laser which has been used to generate them. We address more precisely the physically relevant situation in which the harmonics have much weaker intensities than the one of the laser. In such ( N +1)-color photoionization processes, the atom can simultaneously absorb harmonic uv photons and exchange, i.e., absorb and/or emit, (via stimulated emission) laser ir photons. We have simulated the photoelectron spectra by numerically solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a three-dimensional hydrogen atom in the presence of the radiation pulse. Our results show that, everything else being kept fixed, the magnitudes of the photoelectron peaks are strongly dependent on the difference of phase between successive harmonics. This strong dependence results from interference effects taking place between competing quantum paths leading to a given final state. An interesting feature is that these interferences involve transitions in the continuum states of the atom and do not depend on resonances in the discrete spectrum. Another interesting outcome of our study is to show that such effects should be observable with currently developed harmonic sources. {\copyright}  1996 The American Physical Society.},

    abstract = {The word 'attosecond' (1 as = 10[?]18 s) officially entered the vocabulary of physics when sub-femtosecond pulses of UV/XUV light produced either by nonlinear frequency conversion of a ultra-short infrared pump pulse or Fourier synthesis of broad bandwidth radiation were established. The physics of these pulses is based on nonlinear, nonperturbative laser-atom interaction: stimulated Raman scattering or high harmonic generation (HHG) is used to generate the necessary bandwidth, which naturally encompasses the visible and UV/XUV spectral range. However, the crucial element for attosecond pulse generation is the control of the spectral phase. New methods of temporal characterization at frequencies lying in the UV/XUV had to be elaborated. These methods rely on the energy/momentum analysis of photoelectrons produced by XUV attosecond flashes in the presence of an intense infrared field whose optical cycle itself becomes the basic clock. Single 650 as pulses have been produced and applied to trace the dynamics of electrons inside atoms following the creation of an inner-shell hole. Periodic combs of 250 as pulses have been synthesized by superposing just four harmonics and applying to the attosecond timing of the electron motion in HHG. Although it is easy to increase the bandwidth by coupling more harmonics, a fundamental limit to the duration of the light bursts produced has been discovered. It is imposed by the lack of synchronization of the different harmonic orders. The current limit is estimated to be 130 as. The latest advances include a direct autocorrelation of an attosecond pulse train and the production of a single 250 as soft x-ray pulse. This paper offers a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in the production and characterization of attosecond light pulses, with a glimpse at the first steps in attophysics.},

    abstract = {We investigate experimentally the high-order harmonic generation from aligned CO2 molecules and demonstrate that the modulation inversion of the harmonic yield with respect to molecular alignment can be altered dramatically by fine-tuning the intensity of the driving laser pulse for harmonic generation. The results can be modeled by employing the strong field approximation including a ground state depletion factor. The laser intensity is thus proved to be a parameter that can control the high-harmonic emission from aligned molecules.},

Odd harmonics of the driving laser intensity are observed as a function of gas pressure up to energies of 50 eV. By employing a simple phase matching theory that incorporates the spatial and temporal dependences of ionization within the waveguide, good agreement with the HHG spectral envelope has been obtained, indicating phase matching is the dominant factor in shaping the spectral envelope of the harmonics.},

@article{Gaudiosi2006,
    abstract = {We demonstrate a significant extension of the high-order harmonic cutoff by using a fully-ionized capillary discharge plasma as the generation medium. The preionized plasma dramatically reduces ionization-induced defocusing and energy loss of the driving laser due to ionization. This allows for significantly higher photon energies, up to 150 eV, to be generated from xenon ions, compared with the 70 eV observed previously. We also demonstrate enhancement of the harmonic flux of nearly 2 orders of magnitude at photon energies around 90 eV when the capillary discharge is used to ionize xenon, compared with harmonic generation in a hollow waveguide. The use of a plasma as a medium for high-order harmonic generation shows great promise for extending efficient harmonic generation to much shorter wavelengths using ions.},

Within this context, experiments2 have examined the intensity-dependent ionization but, except for a few cases, technological limitations have confined the majority to wavelengths below 1 μm. The development of intense, ultrafast laser sources in the mid-infrared (1 μm<λ<5 μm) region enables exploration of the wavelength scaling of the Keldysh picture while enabling new opportunities in strong-field physics, control of electronic motion and attosecond science. Here we report a systematic experimental investigation of the wavelength scaling in this region by concurrently analysing the production of energetic electrons and photons emitted by argon atoms interacting with few-cycle, mid-infrared fields. The results support the implicit predictions contained in Keldysh's work, and pave the way to the realization of brighter and shorter attosecond pulsed light sources using longer-wavelength driving fields.},

This establishes unique mapping between parameters of the laser field and attributes of the recolliding wave packet. The method is capable of probing ionic wave packet dynamics with attosecond resolution from an adjustable direction and might be used as an alternative to aligning molecules.

This scheme enables the generation of broadband and tunable attosecond pulses. Instead of fixing the carrier-envelope phase to produce a cosine driver pulse, the phase becomes a control parameter for the center frequency of the attosecond pulse. A method to assess the multiplicity of attosecond pulses in the pulse train is also presented.

    abstract = {Generation of low-order harmonics (third and fifth) of the fundamental radiation of a  Q -switched Nd:YAG laser ( 1064  nm, pulse  15  ns) was observed in a CaF 2  laser ablation plume. The ablation process is triggered by a second  Q -switched Nd:YAG laser operating at  532  or  266  nm. In the scheme employed, the fundamental laser beam propagates parallel to the target surface at controllable distance and temporal delay, allowing to the probing of different regions of the freely expanding plume. The intensity of the harmonics is shown to decrease rapidly as the distance to the target is increased, and for each distance, an optimum time delay between the ablating laser pulse and the fundamental beam is found.  In situ  diagnosis of the plume by optical emission spectroscopy and laser-induced fluorescence serves to correlate the observed harmonic behavior with the temporally and spatially resolved composition and velocity of flight of species in the plume. It is concluded that harmonics are selectively generated by CaF species through a two-photon resonantly enhanced sum-mixing process exploiting the ( B   2 Σ + – X   2 Σ + ,  Δ ν =0 ) transition of the molecule in the region of 530 nm. In this work polar molecules have been shown to be the dominating species for harmonic generation in an ablation plume. Implications of these results for the generation of high harmonics in strongly polar molecules which can be aligned in the ablation plasma are discussed.},

@article{Mourou2006,
    abstract = {The advent of ultraintense laser pulses generated by the technique of chirped pulse amplification (CPA) along with the development of high-fluence laser materials has opened up an entirely new field of optics. The electromagnetic field intensities produced by these techniques, in excess of  10 18    W∕ cm 2 , lead to relativistic electron motion in the laser field. The CPA method is reviewed and the future growth of laser technique is discussed, including the prospect of generating the ultimate power of a zettawatt. A number of consequences of relativistic-strength optical fields are surveyed. In contrast to the nonrelativistic regime, these laser fields are capable of moving matter more effectively, including motion in the direction of laser propagation. One of the consequences of this is wakefield generation, a relativistic version of optical rectification, in which longitudinal field effects could be as large as the transverse ones. In addition to this, other effects may occur, including relativistic focusing, relativistic transparency, nonlinear modulation and multiple harmonic generation, and strong coupling to matter and other fields (such as high-frequency radiation). A proper utilization of these phenomena and effects leads to the new technology of relativistic engineering, in which light-matter interactions in the relativistic regime drives the development of laser-driven accelerator science. A number of significant applications are reviewed, including the fast ignition of an inertially confined fusion target by short-pulsed laser energy and potential sources of energetic particles (electrons, protons, other ions, positrons, pions, etc.). The coupling of an intense laser field to matter also has implications for the study of the highest energies in astrophysics, such as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, with energies in excess of  10 20     eV . The laser fields can be so intense as to make the accelerating field large enough for general relativistic effects (via the equivalence principle) to be examined in the laboratory. It will also enable one to access the nonlinear regime of quantum electrodynamics, where the effects of radiative damping are no longer negligible. Furthermore, when the fields are close to the Schwinger value, the vacuum can behave like a nonlinear medium in much the same way as ordinary dielectric matter expanded to laser radiation in the early days of laser research.},

By driving the high-order harmonic generation process using longer-wavelength midinfrared light, we show that, in theory, fully phase-matched frequency upconversion can extend into the hard X-ray region of the spectrum. We verify our scaling predictions experimentally by demonstrating phase matching in the soft X-ray region of the spectrum around 330 eV, using ultrafast driving laser pulses at 1.3-μm wavelength, in an extended, high-pressure, weakly ionized gas medium. We also show through calculations that scaling of the overall conversion efficiency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making tabletop, fully coherent, multi-keV X-ray sources feasible. The rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield, predicted for harmonics driven by longer-wavelength lasers, is compensated macroscopically by an increased optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the generated X-rays.},

The shortest HCP presently available have a width of about  500    fs  restricting the manipulation of electronic wave packets to those in high-lying Rydberg states. The nonlinear harmonic response of atoms to strong two-color infrared laser pulses with frequencies  ω  and  2 ω  opens up the opportunity to form trains of ultrafast HCP's on an attosecond time scale. In the present contribution, we investigate the influence of macroscopic propagation effects onto the production of HCP and show that trains of unidirectional attosecond HCP's could be produced under experimentally realistic conditions.},

We perform analytical calculations using S-matrix techniques to obtain laser-induced electron diffraction images of a diatomic molecule. The two-color field allows us to control recollision through the combination of two-color gating and polarization gating. By tuning the parameters of the two-color field we reduce the recollision to a single event, obtaining cleaner image and significantly improving time-resolution.

    abstract = {The amplitude and frequency of laser light can be routinely measured and controlled on a femtosecond (10-15 s) timescale1. However, in pulses comprising just a few wave cycles, the amplitude envelope and carrier frequency are not sufficient to characterize and control laser radiation, because evolution of the light field is also influenced by a shift of the carrier wave with respect to the pulse peak2. This so-called carrier-envelope phase has been predicted3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and observed10 to affect strong-field phenomena, but random shot-to-shot shifts have prevented the reproducible guiding of atomic processes using the electric field of light. Here we report the generation of intense, few-cycle laser pulses with a stable carrier envelope phase that permit the triggering and steering of microscopic motion with an ultimate precision limited only by quantum mechanical uncertainty. Using these reproducible light waveforms, we create light-induced atomic currents in ionized matter; the motion of the electronic wave packets can be controlled on timescales shorter than 250 attoseconds (250 × 10-18 s). This enables us to control the attosecond temporal structure of coherent soft X-ray emission produced by the atomic currents—these X-ray photons provide a sensitive and intuitive tool for determining the carrier-envelope phase.},

Until now, all CEP measurements have been made by averaging over a large number of phase-stabilized laser pulses. Here, we demonstrate the first single-shot CEP measurement of intense few-cycle laser pulses. We focus a laser pulse on a gas target and detect photoelectrons emitted in opposing directions ('left–right') parallel to the polarization of the laser. By comparing the left–right asymmetries of photoelectrons at different energies, we mapped the CEP of consecutive non-phase-stabilized pulses on a parametric plot. This new evaluation method enables us to determine the CEP without phase ambiguity at unprecedented measurement precision. Future investigation of phase-dependent phenomena with CEP tagging at a much lower phase jitter than accessible at present with phase-stabilized lasers is now possible.},

Our results show that the initially created hole charge remains stationary but on top of it the system reacts by an ultrafast π-π∗ excitation followed by a cyclic excitation-de-excitation process which leads to a redistribution of the charge. The π-π∗ excitation following the removal of the {HOMO} electron takes place on a subfemtosecond time scale and the period of the excitation-de-excitation alternations is about 1.4 fs. In real space the processes of excitation and de-excitation represent ultrafast delocalization and localization of the charge. The results are analyzed by simple two- and three-state models.},

    abstract = {Dynamics of electronic motion when the nuclei are clamped is discussed and shown to be always described as a superposition of adiabatic electronic states. These states are stationary when the nuclei are clamped but their superposition leads to multiply periodic motion where the natural frequencies are the differences in the energies of the adiabatic electronic states. When one or more of the frequencies are low and the atoms are allowed to move, the electronic rearrangement is commensurate with the motion of the nuclei. This is the usual breakdown of the {Born–Oppenheimer} approximation. But when the electronic frequencies are higher there is an electronic motion before the nuclei move. The motion can be demonstrated through expectation values such as the multipole moments of the charge distribution. Such superposition states will be excited when the laser pulse width in energy exceeds the spacings of the states. For low-lying valence excited or low Rydberg states this requires a femtosecond or shorter laser pulse. Since the carrier frequency has to be comparable to the excitation energy, the required laser pulses must span only a few cycles.},

The past decade has seen the emergence of new methods that are also aimed at imaging chemical reactions as they occur, based on X-ray diffraction1, electron diffraction2 or laser-induced recollision3, 4—with spectral selection not available for any of these new methods. Here we show that in the case of high-harmonic spectroscopy based on recollision, this apparent limitation becomes a major advantage owing to the coherent nature of the attosecond high-harmonic pulse generation. The coherence allows the unexcited molecules to act as local oscillators against which the dynamics are observed, so a transient grating technique5, 6 can be used to reconstruct the amplitude and phase of emission from the excited molecules. We then extract structural information from the amplitude, which encodes the internuclear separation, by quantum interference at short times and by scattering of the recollision electron at longer times. The phase records the attosecond dynamics of the electrons, giving access to the evolving ionization potentials and the electronic structure of the transient molecule. In our experiment, we are able to document a temporal shift of the high-harmonic field of less than an attosecond (1 as = 10−18 s) between the stretched and compressed geometry of weakly vibrationally excited Br2 in the electronic ground state. The ability to probe structural and electronic features, combined with high time resolution, make high-harmonic spectroscopy ideally suited to measuring coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics occurring in photochemical reactions and to characterizing the electronic structure of transition states.},

@article{Lin2010review,
    abstract = {When an atom or molecule is exposed to a short intense laser pulse, electrons that were removed at an earlier time may be driven back by the oscillating electric field of the laser to recollide with the parent ion, to incur processes like high-order harmonic generation ({HHG}), high-energy above-threshold ionization ({HATI}) and nonsequential double ionization ({NSDI}). Over the years, a rescattering model (the three-step model) has been used to understand these strong field phenomena qualitatively, but not quantitatively. Recently we have established such a quantitative rescattering ({QRS}) theory. According to {QRS}, the yields for {HHG}, {HATI} and {NSDI} can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet with various  field-free  electron–ion scattering cross sections, namely photo-recombination, elastic electron scattering and electron-impact ionization, respectively. The validity of {QRS} is first demonstrated by comparing with accurate numerical results from solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation ({TDSE}) for atoms. It is then applied to atoms and molecules to explain recent experimental data. According to {QRS}, accurate  field-free  electron scattering and photoionization cross sections can be obtained from the {HATI} and {HHG} spectra, respectively. These cross sections are the conventional tools for studying the structure of a molecule; thus, {QRS} serves to provide the required theoretical foundation for the self-imaging of a molecule in strong fields by its own electrons. Since infrared lasers of duration of a few femtoseconds are readily available today, these results imply that they are suitable for probing the dynamics of molecules with temporal resolutions of a few femtoseconds.},

We show that such rearrangement offers an alternative pathway to the ionization of orbitals more deeply bound than the highest occupied molecular orbital. This pathway is not subject to the full exponential suppression characteristic of direct tunnel ionization from the deeper orbitals. The departing electron produces an 'attosecond correlation pulse' which controls the rearrangement during the tunnelling process.

This observation cannot be explained in the standard treatment of the Lewenstein model and has been ascribed to many-electron effects or the influence of the Coulomb force on the continuum electron. We show that nonvanishing ellipticity naturally appears within the Lewenstein model when using a multicenter stationary-phase method for treating the dynamics of the continuum electron. The reason for this is the appearance of additional contributions, which can be interpreted as quantum orbits in which the active electron is ionized at one atomic center within the molecule and recombines at another. The associated exchange harmonics are responsible for the nonvanishing ellipticity and result from a correlation between the ionization site and the recombination site in high-order harmonic generation.},

We manipulated the phase and amplitude of five discrete harmonics spanning the blue to mid-infrared frequencies to produce instantaneous optical fields in the shape of square, sawtooth, and subcycle sine and cosine pulses at a repetition rate of 125 terahertz. Furthermore, we developed an all-optical shaper-assisted linear cross-correlation technique to retrieve these fields and thereby verified their shapes and confirmed the critical role of carrier-envelope phase in Fourier synthesis of optical waveforms.},

Insight into and control of their atomic-scale motion are the key to understanding the functioning of biological systems, developing efficient sources of x-ray light, and speeding up electronics. Capturing and steering this electron motion require attosecond resolution and control, respectively (1 attosecond = 10-18 seconds). A recent revolution in technology has afforded these capabilities: Controlled light waves can steer electrons inside and around atoms, marking the birth of lightwave electronics. Isolated attosecond pulses, well reproduced and fully characterized, demonstrate the power of the new technology. Controlled few-cycle light waves and synchronized attosecond pulses constitute its key tools. We review the current state of lightwave electronics and highlight some future directions. 10.1126/science.1142855},

Within this framework we have treated in a unified fashion the alignment with laser pulses of varying duration from the short pulse impulsive limit ({τpulse⪡Trot}) to the long pulse adiabatic limit ({τpulse>Trot}). The temporal behavior of the alignment in both these limits, and in the intermediate pulse duration regime, have been analyzed. For the impulsive limit the dependence of the degree of maximum alignment upon the laser pulse duration was examined and the intensity-dependent optimum pulse duration explained. A comparison between the degree of alignment under the same conditions of pulse intensity and rotational temperature was performed between the impulsive and adiabatic cases. The adiabatic case was found to always provide a better degree of alignment for a given intensity which we show is due to the zero relative phasing between the component states of the superposition that form the pendular states. We have explicitly calculated the angular distribution of an ensemble of linear molecules as it evolves through a rotational revival; a rich structure is found that may be useful in guiding future experiments that utilize the field free alignment in a revival.},

However, until recently measurement of MFPADs relied on determining the molecular orientation after ionization1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, which is limited to species and processes where ionization leads to fragmentation. An alternative is to fix the molecular frame before ionization. The only demonstrations of such spatial orientation involved aligned small linear nonpolar molecules5, 6, 14. Here we extend these techniques to the general class of polar molecules. Carbonylsulphide and benzonitrile molecules, fixed in space by combined laser and electrostatic fields, are ionized with intense, circularly polarized 30-fs laser pulses. For carbonylsulphide and benzonitrile oriented in one dimension, the MFPADs exhibit pronounced anisotropies perpendicular to the fixed permanent dipole moment, which are absent for randomly oriented molecules. Furthermore, for benzonitrile oriented in three dimensions, striking suppression of electron emission in the fixed molecular plane appears. Our theoretical analysis, based on tunnelling ionization theory15, 16, shows that the MFPADs reflect permanent dipole moments and polarizabilities of both the neutral molecule and its cation, and nodal planes of occupied electronic orbitals. These results point to future opportunities for time-resolved probing of valence electron dynamics.},

Samples of aligned or oriented molecules can be obtained following the interaction with an intense laser field7, 8, 9, enabling experiments in the molecular rather than the laboratory frame10, 11, 12. However, the degree of impulsive molecular orientation and alignment that can be achieved using a single laser field is limited13 and crucially depends on the initial states, which are thermally populated. Here we report the successful demonstration of a new technique for laser-field-free orientation and alignment of molecules that combines an electrostatic field, non-resonant femtosecond laser excitation14 and the preparation of state-selected molecules using a hexapole2. As a unique quantum-mechanical wavepacket is formed, a large degree of orientation and alignment is observed both during and after the femtosecond laser pulse, which is even further increased (to cos=-0.74 and cos2=0.82, respectively) by tailoring the shape of the femtosecond laser pulse. This work should enable new applications such as the study of reaction dynamics or collision experiments in the molecular frame, and orbital tomography11 of heteronuclear molecules.},

The comparison between several gases, xenon, argon and neon, and different orders, from the 17th to the 33rd, shows that the rotation angle and ellipticity strongly depends on the position of the harmonic in the spectrum, and in particular, whether it is in the cutoff or in the plateau. In the plateau, the rotation angle is quite large, and the ellipticity follows that of the fundamental, remaining, however, smaller. The radiation is only partially polarized. In contrast, in the cutoff, both rotation angle and ellipticity remain small, independently of the laser ellipticity. Our experimental results compare well with theoretical predictions including the single-atom response and propagation effects.},

We show that the coherent laser coupling induced between the  2 Σ + g (1sσ g ) ground state and the first excited  2 Σ + u (2pσ u ) state leads to two dominating amplitudes for the high-order harmonic generation that may interfere: amplitudes describing recombination back into the σ g  and σ u  states, respectively. These two amplitudes may interfere destructively or constructively. The effect of a destructive interference is very clear through the occurrence of a minimum in the high-order harmonic spectrum. We show cases where such a minimum in the spectrum is approximately at the position predicted by the simple two-centre interference formula.},

In contrast to the {SFA} and the single-state {TDER} model, in both of which the {HHG} rates in the region of the high-energy plateau cutoff involve only the plane-wave (first Born) approximation for the photorecombination cross section, our analytic expression for the {HHG} rates in the two-state {TDER} model involves the exact photorecombination cross section for this model. These results justify the factorization of {HHG} rates in the high-energy plateau region in terms of the electron wave packet and the exact ({non-Born}) photorecombination cross section, which was suggested previously using only phenomenological arguments.},

It is shown that γ has significance only for the quasistatic electric ({QSE}) fields that underlie the tunneling model. The plane-wave ({PW}) fields produced by lasers are fundamentally different, with that difference becoming more emphatic as intensity increases. The gauge transformation that relates {QSE} and {PW} fields is valid only in a limited domain whose boundaries are not evident in a {QSE} context. The Keldysh γ is shown to have no special meaning for laser-induced processes.},

Although the physical entities are recognized by the existence of invariant quantities, examples from classical and quantum physics suggest that not all the theoretical terms refer to the entities: some terms refer to properties of the entities, and some terms have only an epistemic function. In particular, it is argued that the wavefunction may be written in terms of classical non-referring and epistemic terms. The implications for realist interpretations of quantum mechanics and on the teaching of quantum physics are examined.},

@article{Reiss1980Effect,
    abstract = {The approximation method introduced by Keldysh is revised and extended. The technique is applicable to the photodetachment by a plane-wave field of an electron bound by a short-range potential. The approximation is to neglect the effect of the binding potential as compared to the field effects on the final state of the detached electron. By choice of a different gauge than that used by Keldysh, the formalism becomes very simple and tractable. A general basis for the formalism is developed, and it is then applied to find transition probabilities for any order of interaction for both linearly and circularly polarized plane-wave fields. The low-intensity, first-order limit and the high-intensity, high-order limit yield the correct results. Two intensity parameters are identified. The fundamental one is z=e2a2/4mω, where a is the magnitude of the vector potential (in radiation gauge) of the field of circular frequency ω. The second parameter is {z1=2zω/EB}, where {EB} is binding energy, and it becomes important only in the asymptotic case. With the assumption that the field leaves the neutral atomic core relatively unaffected, the formalism is applied to the example of the negative hydrogen ion irradiated by circularly or linearly polarized 10.6-μm radiation. Photodetachment angular distributions and total transition probabilities are examined for explicit intensity effects. It is found that total transition probability W is not sensitive to intensity since {d(logW})/d (logz) retains low-intensity straight-line behavior up to quite high values of z. An important intensity effect is the major significance of higher-than-lowest-order terms when z is large, especially for circular polarization. A sensitive indicator of intensity is the ratio of photodetachment probabilities in circularly and linearly polarized fields, which increases sharply with intensity. An investigation of the convergence of perturbation expansions gives the upper limit {z<[EB}/{ω]-EB}/ω, where the square bracket means "smallest integer containing" the quantity in brackets. This limit is z<0.59 for H- in 10.6-μm radiation. The failure of perturbation theory is not necessarily manifest in qualitative ways. For example, it is not apparent in total photoelectron yield as a function of intensity.},

@article{Reiss1990Complete,
    abstract = {An investigation of the foundations of strong-field theories of the Keldysh type is undertaken. It is found first that the Volkov solution, upon which the Keldysh approximation depends, exists unambiguously only in the relativistic case. Accordingly, a fully relativistic theory of atomic photoionization is formulated from first principles. A strong-field approximation ({SFA}) is expressed, based only on the proposition that the photoionizing field dominates the atomic potential in the final state. The nonrelativistic limit of the {SFA} gives exactly one of the known Keldysh-type theories, but the original Keldysh theory itself is found to neglect some fraction of the strong-field effects. It is shown on a variety of grounds that A2 terms must be fully retained in Keldysh-type theories. Important in this matter are the proper application of asymptotic conditions, the interchangeability of A⋅p and A2 terms, and the consistent reduction to the nonrelativistic limit.},
